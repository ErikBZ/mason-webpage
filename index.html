        <p>Hello there, thank you for visiting my little corner of the internet.
           There's not much here right now but I will be adding to this website
           with various projects I've worked on as well as homework assignments.
           Hopefully I don't reach the 30 MB limit too fast. Also the nav bar
           doesn't actually work just yet, as you may have noticed. For now I'll
           just have a short description of one of my projects with some fun pictures.

            Photoness: How to judge whether or not a digital image is a photo
        </a></h2>
        <p>
            Currently I'm messing around with digital images and trying to get a
            computer to differentiate photos from other types of pictures, such
            as paintings, cartoons, and 2d renders of 3d video games, or animated works.
            As of right now, I am using ppm images since those are the easiest to read
            and the only image files that I decided to research. Also we used ppm
            in CS 262 and I didn't feel like learning how to get info from png's or
            jpeg's.<br><br>
            Since ppm images are just giant matrices of bytes, they can be read into
            a 2d array or a really large array where the positions will be deciphered
            later on, which is what I chose to do. Kind of I studied the the image.c
            program that was given to us for CS 262 to create my own which is similar
            but has a lot less functionality. Given that simple base, I wrote a program
            that calculates color blobs within an image using a simple queue and a 
            breadth first search. Using a queue basically makes the search breadth first
            anyway. Using a stack, or a depth first search causes some issues
            where the the head of searcher begins to hit itself. At least this
            was the case the way I implemented it. The basic algorithm I used is as follows:
        <p>
            <div>
                <p class="code">
                /* 
                    Given an array "visisted" of bools where all indeces that have been
                    added to another blob are true, and all others are false,
                    a starting index "start", and an array of pixels "img"
                */
                Blob b;
                // instantiate b
                Queue intQueue
                // instantiate intQueue
                enqueue(intQueue, start);
                visited[start] = true;      // the starting index will be added
                while(intQueue.size != 0)
                {
                    int next = dequeue(intQueue);   // get the next index
                    AddToBlob(b, next);             // add the index to the blob
                    AverageColors(b, img[next]);    // average out the colors
                    
                    int up = GetPixelUp(next, img); // do the same for left, right, down
                    
                    if(up != -1 && visited[up] && ColorIsSimilar(next, up))
                    {
                        enqueue(intQueue, up);
                        visited[up] = 1;
                    }
                    // once again do the same for left, right, down
                }
                <p>

            The image on the right shows some sample output of the first part of
            the program which calculates various metrics of the image. As of now
            I don't know how well I chose the metrics to use for the calculation
            of "photoness" but I am still messing with these numbers to get the
            best possible solution. After these metrics are caculated, the statistics
            are fed into the second part of the program which uses a genetic algorithmn
            to find the best way to calculate photoness from the given metrics.
